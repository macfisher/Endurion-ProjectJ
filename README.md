Project J/Supernatural/Guns 'n' Ghosts by _endurion_
====================================================
Back in February 2011, endurion started a tutorial for a new C64 game under the title of **Project J**. Almost exactly two
years passed, and after 99 steps the tutorial was declared complete. The resulting game **Supernatural** was polished and
released commercially as **Guns 'n' Ghosts** which you can [purchase here.](http://www.psytronik.net/main/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=105%3Agunsghosts&catid=34%3Acommodore-64&Itemid=57)
You may also purchase a physical cartridge via [here.](http://www.rgcd.co.uk/2013/04/guns-n-ghosts-cartridge-available-c64.html)

I (smithrobs) wanted to visualize the progression of the tutorial and ended up scraping the steps from the original thread
located at [RetroRemakes](http://www.retroremakes.com/remaketalk/index.php?p=/discussion/2391/how-to-write-a-c64-game-in-several-steps/p1).
Each step in the tutorial is a git commit, allowing one to see the diffs between steps for educational
purposes.

Compilation
===========
There are multiple custom utilities in the repo that require Windows to execute. That said, the outputs are included, so
you should be able to compile on a non-Windows machine before step 51.

* For steps 1-50, the ASM can be compiled with [ACME 0.90](http://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/).
* After step 50, you will need to use endurion's [C64Studio](http://www.georg-rottensteiner.de/en/index.html) (Windows
only) to compile.
